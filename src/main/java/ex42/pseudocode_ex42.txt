public class Employee {
     String First;
     String Last;
     String Salary;
}
Main:

1. Print the header for the table

2. Create array of employee and call ReadEmployeeList()

3. Now we have a full list of employees

4. We can print the array until it goes null

        while(Input[i]!=null)
                {
                    System.out.printf("%10s %10s %10s\n", Input[i].First, Input[i].Last, Input[i].Salary);
                    i++;
                }

ReadEmployeeList:

1. Open and read in.txt file at correct filepath
2. Make sure to split at a comma instead of a space due to the formatting of the input file.
3. for every iteration of: while (scanIn.hasNext()) where scanIn is the name of a Scanner Object reading from the file
        store the corresponding value for temp into the employee class structure
 String[] temp = s.split(",");

                   a[i] = new Employee();
                   a[i].First = temp[0];
                   a[i].Last = temp[1];
                   a[i].Salary = temp[2];
                   i++;

4. return Employee[]
