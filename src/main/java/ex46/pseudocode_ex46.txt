MAIN

* use a treemap to store the "keys" or words in the sequence because it will be easier to find them with a value
* I can hold a key (word) and the value could be the amount of times it shows up.

        TreeMap<String,Integer> words = new TreeMap<String,Integer>();

1. set scanner onto the filepath
2. loop through the whole file, use sc.hasnext() so it only stops at spaces
3. every iteration, check if the key exists. If it does, add to the value
4. if the key doesn't exist, add the key, set the value to one

METHODS

Change the value associated with a key to a string of stars:
for i -> value-1
{
    string s = s + *;
}

return s;
